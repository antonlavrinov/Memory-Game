## Memory Game. React App. 

It's a test project that was built with React to improve my programming skills. The rules of this game are simple:

* Match the cards on board till the time runs out. The cards contain images of sweets of different kinds. The fat devil is watching your every move and swears to steal all those sweets from you.

* If you fail to match the cards in time the devil will rejoice and leave you with nothing.

* If you succeed in this game you'll see the devil cry. And you will get one candy as a prize for your victory. 

* You can collect all the candies that you won in this game in your Candy Bag.

* You can also feed the devil with one of the candies from your bag if you wish to show some kindness to the poor creature ;)
